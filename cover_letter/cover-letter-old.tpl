${COMPANY}


Dear Hiring/Recruitment Team --

I am writing to express my interest in the ${ROLE} position at ${COMPANY}. With over 10 years of experience in IT and 7+ years specializing in cloud infrastructure, automation, DevOps and orchestration, I bring a combination of software engineering expertise, deep cloud knowledge and strong operational reliability practices that align well with your team’s needs.

Throughout my career, I’ve built and maintained scalable cloud platforms across AWS, GCP and Azure, automated CI/CD pipelines, designed Kubernetes-based architectures, implemented GitOps workflows and delivered internal tools that improved development efficiency and system reliability. My work includes end-to-end DevOps ownership: from infrastructure automation using Terraform/Ansible, to container orchestration with EKS/GKE/AKS to observability stacks.

In my recent role as an Automation & Platform Engineer at Emapta, I designed automated deployment pipelines, optimized Kubernetes workloads and improved platform scalability through IaC and GitOps. In previous roles, I led DevOps modernization initiatives, built automation frameworks from scratch, improved release processes and supported large-scale distributed systems with high uptime requirements. My background in network engineering (CCNA) also enables me to diagnose complex infrastructure and networking issues quickly.

I am passionate about building reliable systems, reducing manual effort through automation, improving developer experience and enabling engineering teams to deploy efficiently and safely. I take ownership of problems end-to-end, collaborate effectively across teams and bring a practical, solution-focused mindset to every challenge.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience in cloud platforms, Kubernetes, automation and reliability engineering to ${COMPANY}. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can add value to your engineering team.


All the best,
<strong>Mark Mon E. Monteros</strong>
DevOps/Platform Engineer
