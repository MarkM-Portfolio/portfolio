Hiring Manager
${COMPANY}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the DevOps Engineer position at ${COMPANY}. With over 7 years of hands-on experience in DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, and Platform Engineering, I am confident in my ability to contribute immediate value to your engineering and operations organization.

In my current role as an Automation/Platform Engineer at Emapta, I designed and implemented cloud-native architectures across AWS, automated release processes, and modernized deployment workflows that significantly improved engineering efficiency. I successfully reduced AWS operational costs by 20–30%, automated 80% of manual tasks, and shortened deployments from 2–3 days to 15–30 minutes through optimized CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration.

My experience includes managing multi-cluster Kubernetes environments, implementing GitOps workflows using ArgoCD, building 15+ CI/CD pipelines, and deploying containerized microservices across distributed systems. I am especially strong in troubleshooting production issues end-to-end—across AWS, Kubernetes, networking, and application layers—ensuring reliability, scalability, and security.

I am passionate about improving developer productivity, eliminating operational bottlenecks, and building infrastructure that scales reliably. What excites me most about ${COMPANY} is the opportunity to contribute to a high-impact engineering team where automation, cloud excellence, and continuous improvement are core values.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in DevOps, automation, Kubernetes, and cloud engineering aligns with the goals of your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to ${COMPANY}.

Sincerely,
Mark Mon E. Monteros
